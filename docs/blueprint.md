## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#3498DB) to inspire trust and precision. We've selected blue to instill a sense of trust and reliability. This particular hue is saturated and relatively bright, which is meant to feel contemporary and forward-thinking.
- Background color: Light blue (#EBF5FB) to create a clean and calm environment. We've chosen a background color that is visibly blue, but highly desaturated and bright. Its brightness also suits our selection of a light color scheme.
- Accent color: A contrasting purple (#8E44AD) to highlight key actions and elements. Purple sits adjacent to blue in the color wheel; we make it stand apart from our primary color with greater saturation and a darker shade.
- Roboto font for clear and modern text presentation.
- Grouping of form elements to provide an intuitive flow.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects for a smooth user experience.
